### âœ… Task 2: Update Book Status on Return
- A stored procedure `add_return_records`:
  - Inserts return records.
  - Retrieves book details.
  - (Optional enhancement) Updates book status to 'yes'.

### âœ… Task 3: Branch Performance Report
- Creates a report using `CTAS`:
  - Total books issued
  - Total books returned
  - Total revenue per branch
  - Return rate percentage

### âœ… Task 4: Create Active Members Table
- Creates `active_members` table using `CTAS`.
- Includes members who borrowed books in the last 2 months.

### âœ… Task 5: Top 3 Employees by Issued Books
- Finds top 3 employees who issued the most books.
- Returns: `employee_name`, `total_issued`, and `branch_id`.
